# Speaklio Backend

This directory is reserved for the planned Speaklio backend service.

## Planned Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript
- Supabase Auth
- Supabase Postgres with Row Level Security

## Planned Responsibilities

The backend should handle workflows that should not run directly in the browser or a future mobile app:

- AI/LLM requests.
- Transient audio transcription orchestration.
- Secret API keys.
- Account deletion.
- Privileged Supabase operations.
- Future webhooks or scheduled jobs.

Ordinary user-owned data may still be read or written directly through Supabase from the client when protected by Row Level Security.

## Current Status

Not implemented yet. See `../BACKEND_BRAINSTORM.md` for planning notes.

The Supabase project structure has been initialized at `../supabase/`, including the first schema migration and seed data.

## Early Implementation Notes

- Do not expose Supabase secret/service keys to frontend or mobile code.
- Prefer request validation for all public routes.
- Keep raw audio transient for the initial LLM flow.
- Keep API contracts frontend-agnostic so the app can later support web, mobile, or both.
